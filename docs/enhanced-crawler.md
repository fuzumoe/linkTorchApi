# Enhanced Crawler Implementation with Go Channels

## Overview

This implementation enhances the URL crawler with advanced concurrency patterns using Go channels. Key features include:

1. **Priority-based Queue System**: Three levels of priority for URL processing
2. **Real-time Result Streaming**: A dedicated channel for immediate crawl results
3. **Dynamic Worker Pool Management**: Add or remove workers based on load
4. **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper resource cleanup and task completion

## Key Components

### 1. Priority Queues

The crawler now has three priority queues:
- `highPriority`: For urgent URLs that need immediate processing
- `normalPriority`: For standard URL processing
- `lowPriority`: For URLs that can wait

### 2. Result Channel

A dedicated `results` channel emits `CrawlResult` objects that contain:
- URL ID and full URL
- Processing status
- Error information (if any)
- Number of links found
- Processing duration

### 3. Control Channel

The `controlChan` accepts commands to dynamically adjust the crawler:
- Add workers during high load periods
- Remove workers during idle periods

### 4. Priority-based Worker Processing

Workers now check queues in priority order:
1. First check the high priority queue
2. Then check normal priority
3. Finally check low priority

## Usage Examples

### Enqueuing with Priority

```go
// Enqueue high priority URL
crawlerPool.EnqueueWithPriority(urlID, 8)

// Enqueue normal priority URL
crawlerPool.Enqueue(urlID) // or EnqueueWithPriority(urlID, 5)

// Enqueue low priority URL
crawlerPool.EnqueueWithPriority(urlID, 2)
```

### Processing Results in Real-time

```go
results := crawlerPool.GetResults()
for result := range results {
    fmt.Printf("URL %d processed: %s (status: %s, links: %d, time: %v)\n",
        result.URLID, result.URL, result.Status, result.LinkCount, result.Duration)

    // Update UI, trigger notifications, etc.
    if result.Error != nil {
        // Handle errors
    }
}
```

### Dynamic Worker Adjustment

```go
// Add workers during high traffic
crawlerPool.AdjustWorkers(crawler.ControlCommand{
    Action: "add",
    Count:  5,
})

// Remove workers during low traffic
crawlerPool.AdjustWorkers(crawler.ControlCommand{
    Action: "remove",
    Count:  2,
})
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Resource Utilization**: Process URLs based on importance
2. **Real-time Monitoring**: Monitor crawler progress as it happens
3. **Adaptability**: Adjust to changing load conditions
4. **Cleaner Shutdown**: Properly handle all resources on exit

## Future Enhancements

1. Implement rate limiting per domain
2. Add crawl depth control
3. Add URL filtering based on patterns
4. Implement persistent job queue for crawler
5. Add metrics collection for performance monitoring
